Selenium Bot with the use of threading

Improvement on the pynputBot, this bot autofills out Google forms and submits them then reloads the page to repeat the process.

This specific repo was made to continuously vote for Gordon College's Meghan Foley for the 2020 Beyond Sports Women's Collegiate All-Star Game. The form can be found here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVNRudfbclxj09DsAOIawmmYmE4fNYPKwxKAds1TSTdtkfCw/viewform.

Please refer to appendix A for a demonstration of the bot running.
